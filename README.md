# Accessible Components  
I've built a good handful of accessible markup patterns and widgets at this point. Each is based on testing with users, UX and design needs of past projects, and from following W3C specifications & notes. 

Here's a listing of all the ones I've actually put enough effort into making public with explainers, demos n' such.

* [Accordions (v3)](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions)  
* [ARIA Links (v2)](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-links)   
* [ARIA Buttons (v2)](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_button)

## More may come...
I update these patterns as I see fit, and will list any new ones I create here.

If you end up using any of these components, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/scottohara)!  

Most importantly, if you ever come across a bug or awkward UX quirk with a component listed here, please file an issue in the that component's GitHub repository.  

Thanks!
